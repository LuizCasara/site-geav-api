## What Still Needs to Be Implemented

1. **Repository Layer**
   - Lugar repository implementation
   - Cancao repository implementation
   - Tag repositories implementation
   - Ramo repository implementation

2. **API Handlers**
   - Lugar handlers for CRUD operations
   - Cancao handlers for CRUD operations
   - Tag handlers for CRUD operations
   - Ramo handlers for CRUD operations

3. **Lambda Functions**
   - Lugar Lambda function entry point
   - Cancao Lambda function entry point

## How to Complete the Implementation

To complete the implementation, you should:

1. **Implement the remaining repositories**
   - Follow the pattern established in the user repository
   - Implement CRUD operations for each entity
   - Handle relationships between entities

2. **Implement the remaining handlers**
   - Follow the pattern established in the user handlers
   - Implement CRUD operations for each entity
   - Add proper logging and error handling

3. **Implement the remaining Lambda functions**
   - Follow the pattern established in the user Lambda function
   - Create router functions for each entity
   - Connect to the appropriate handlers

## Testing and Deployment

Once you've completed the implementation:

1. **Test locally**
   - Use the provided test-local.ps1 script
   - Test each endpoint to ensure it works as expected

2. **Deploy to AWS**
   - Use the provided deploy.ps1 script
   - Initialize the database using the provided script
   - Test the deployed API

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a serverless API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. The API provides CRUD operations for users, places (lugares), and songs (cancoes). The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, and the API logs actions to both CloudWatch and the database.

The architecture follows a clean, layered approach:

1. **API Layer (Lambda Functions)**
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Routes requests to the appropriate handlers

2. **Handler Layer**
   - Implements business logic
   - Validates input
   - Calls repository methods
   - Formats responses

3. **Repository Layer**
   - Handles database operations
   - Implements CRUD operations for each entity
   - Manages relationships between entities

4. **Model Layer**
   - Defines the data structures
   - Implements validation logic
   - Provides helper methods

5. **Logging Layer**
   - Logs API actions to CloudWatch
   - Logs API actions to the database
   - Provides a consistent logging interface

The infrastructure is defined using CloudFormation, making it easy to deploy and manage the AWS resources.
